# SportsBettingAIWorkflow
AI-Powered Sports Betting Intelligence Platform

This project is a WIP of an end-to-end system that ingests live and historical sports betting data (starting with MLB odds), stores it in a structured PostgreSQL database, and exposes it to AI agents capable of answering natural language queries, identifying +EV opportunities, analyzing market movement, and generating actionable insights. The long-term goal is a scalable platform where LLMs interact with real-time betting data, stats, and projections to assist bettors, analysts, and developers.
